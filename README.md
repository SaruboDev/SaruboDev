## 🔥 Hi, I'm SaruboDev.
I'm a Data Scientist with knowledge about:
 - 📊 Effective and clear EDA Process;
 - 💻 Machine Learning and Deep Learning Model creation, training and support;
 - 📑 SQL and BigData;
 - 🐍 Python with Frameworks like:
   - Tensorflow
   - Jax / Equinox
   - Numpy
   - Pandas
   - MatplotLib / Seaborn

## 🔭 My Goals
To find and explore alternative and possibly more efficient model creation and training beyond Backpropagation and similar methods,<br>
exploring bio-inspired techniques and algorithms that can bring new heights to AI.
